/*
 * In every source code or header file that you use it is necessary to prototype
 * your VISA variables at the beginning of the file. You need to declare the VISA
 * session, VISA integers, VISA strings, VISA pointers, and VISA floating variables.
 * Remember that if you are prototyping variables that are to be used as part of the
 * VISA session that need this prototyping. As an example, above retCount has been
 * prototyped as a static variable to this particular module.   It is an integer of
 * bit length 32. If you are uncertain how to declare your VISA prototypes refer
 * to the VISA help under the Section titled Type Assignments Table. The VISA
 * help is located in your NI-VISA directory or folder.

     * Now we will open a VISA session to a device at Primary Address 2.
     * You can use any address for your instrument. In this example we are
     * using GPIB Primary Address 2.
     *
     * We must use the handle from viOpenDefaultRM and we must
     * also use a string that indicates which instrument to open.  This
     * is called the instrument descriptor.  The format for this string
     * can be found in the NI-VISA User Manual.
     * After opening a session to the device, we will get a handle to
     * the instrument which we will use in later VISA functions.
     * The two parameters in this function which are left blank are
     * reserved for future functionality.  These two parameters are
     * given the value VI_NULL.
     *
     * This example will also work for serial or VXI instruments by changing
     * the instrument descriptor from GPIB0::2::INSTR to ASRL1::INSTR or
     * VXI0::2::INSTR depending on the necessary descriptor for your
     * instrument.
